        "- Descriptive statistics summarize and describe data you already have.\n",
        "- Examples: mean, median, mode, charts, tables.\n",
        "- Example: Average marks of a class = 75\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inferential statistics use a sample to make conclusions about a population.\n",
        "- Examples: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, prediction.\n",
        "- Example: Surveying 100 customers to estimate satisfaction of all customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is sampling in statistics? Explain the differences between random and stratified sampling.\n",
        "- Sampling means selecting a subset of data from a population to represent the whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Random Sampling:\n",
        "- Every individual has equal chance\n",
        "- Simple and unbiased\n",
        "- Example: randomly picking 50 students from a school\n",

        "- Stratified Sampling:\n",
        "- Population divided into groups (strata)\n",

        "-Mean = average\n",
        "- Median = middle value\n",
        "- Mode = most frequent value\n",
        "- They summarize data and help understand its center.\n",

        "- Skewness: measures asymmetry\n",
        "- Positive skew → tail on right side (most values are small)\n",
        "- Kurtosis: measures how peaked or flat the distribution is\n",
        "- Positive skew means most data is concentrated on the left with a long right tail.\n",
